# CST8277 Assignment #3 - RMI and Hibernate
This assignment's purpose was to get familiar with RMI and Hibernate. This assignment is basically an "RMI-based 3-tier networked multi-user version" of <a href="https://github.com/richard1990/CST8277-Assignment1">Assignment #1 (Bouncing Sprites)</a>. The server handles the business rules (Sprite creation, movement, etc.), accesses the database, and tells the presentation layer (the client) to display the Sprites. Multiple clients can connect to the server at the same time and see the same number of Sprites and their movement, and each client has a different coloured Sprite associated with it (a randomly generated Color object basically). The Sprites are persistent objects in the database.

SpriteClient.java has all the client code, which just connects to the server and retrieves a list of Sprites. On the server side, the bulk of the code is in SpriteImpl.java which implements an interface (SpriteInterface.java) to allow the creation of Sprites, the JPanel window size, the Sprite movement, and the Sprite colour. Each Sprite created is also stored in a database using Hibernate.

I also included a basic <a href="https://github.com/richard1990/CST8277-Assignment3/blob/master/Class_Diagram.png">Class Diagram</a> and <a href="https://github.com/richard1990/CST8277-Assignment3/blob/master/Sequence_Diagram.png">Sequence Diagram</a>.
